# Reflection Responses

1. One technical concept I've developed mastery over through this project is using nested containers/flexboxes in html and css. My mental model nested containers is how, each container can have however many elements but when theres a container around some of those elements, the outside container when using flex will consider that as one entity. An example of where I used this in my project is in my contact form. I have the #contact section itself set as a column, but I have a nested container with a class of form-info set to a row in order to get my alternative ways to contact me and my fill out form to be side by side.

2. The hardest part of this project was fully understanding how transformation/transition and flexbox work. Because I was absent for a week due to my surgery, I had to figure out alot of things on my own. By doing my own research, asking my peers, and consulting with AI I was able to gain a deeper understanding on all the topics I needed to complete this portolio project.

3. I leverage AI in my projects by using it to help me debug issues and figuring out concepts, by understanding the ideas it's proposing to me, I can further develop my skills and apply those ideas to my future projects. I ensure that it's doesn't generate entire sections as I want to be able to fully understand the response and why it works in this instance or process.

# AI Usage Document

This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19WgbH1L2gSX26s95bzNKxwfw4r3CBImzltuhB597nQs/edit?tab=t.0) to see how I used AI on this project.
